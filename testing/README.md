## Introduction

Testing is a critical part of Laravel application development. Laravel provides excellent testing support with built-in integration for PHPUnit and Pest, along with expressive testing helpers for common scenarios like HTTP requests, database interactions, and authentication.

## Best Practices

- [Use PHPUnit or Pest for Testing](./use-phpunit-or-pest-for-testing.md) - Choose between Laravel's officially supported testing frameworks for writing automated tests
- [Stick to One Testing Framework](./stick-to-one-testing-framework.md) - Maintain consistency by using either PHPUnit or Pest throughout your entire test suite, not both
