# Adhere to a Single Standard

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

In the end it doesn't really matter *which* standard you choose, as long as you stick to it. All (own) code written in a project must adhere to it. Discussions on which standard can often times take more energy out of the actual work than just adhering to the chosen standard. Opinions come and go, but community defined standards like PSR-1, PSR-2, PSR-12 and finally PER-2 are broadly accepted.

<a name="why"></a>
## Why

- By implementing a single standard all code has the same amount of cognitive load for the (human) reader. As code is more often read than it is written, this eases with working with the code.  
- Following a community driven standard allows for easier ramping up of new developers from that community to an existing project. This lessens the burden on new developers having to learn a new standard.  
- Uniformity enforced by the chosen standard also has side effects of adhering to more industry standard coding guidelines.
