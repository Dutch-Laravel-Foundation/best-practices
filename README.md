# Laravel Best Practices

A collection of proven guidelines for building, deploying, and maintaining [Laravel](https://laravel.com) applications.

## About This Guide

Every Laravel project is different. What works well for one project might not suit another. These guidelines are suggestions, not strict rules.

Project budget matters too. With limited resources, you may not implement every guideline perfectly. That's okay. Even partial implementation of these practices will benefit your project in the long run.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the Laravel community. For version 1, we're focusing on widely accepted practices. You can add your own guidelines too.

**Current Status:** Some sections are still under development. We're building this incrementally to keep the scope manageable.

### How to Add a Guideline

1. **Choose a category** - Find the best section for your guideline
2. **Create a clear title** - Make it descriptive and concise
3. **Write a brief introduction** - Explain what the practice is
4. **Add a "Why" section** - Explain the benefits
5. **Include code examples** - Show practical implementation
6. **Define project suitability** - When to use this practice and when not to
7. **Add resources** - Link to relevant documentation or articles

### Feedback

This guide is evolving. We welcome your ideas on structure, content, and organization.
