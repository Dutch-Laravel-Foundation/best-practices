# Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security header that helps prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks and other code injection vulnerabilities by defining which sources of content are allowed to be loaded and executed on your web application.

<a name="why"></a>
## Why

- **Prevents XSS attacks** - Blocks execution of malicious scripts injected into your application
- **Reduces code injection risks** - Restricts inline scripts and eval() usage
- **Prevents data exfiltration** - Controls where your application can send data
- **Clickjacking protection** - Prevents your site from being embedded in malicious frames
- **Mixed content prevention** - Ensures HTTPS sites don't load insecure HTTP resources
- **Compliance requirements** - Many security standards now require CSP implementation

<a name="suitable-for"></a>
## Suitable For

- All Laravel applications, especially those handling sensitive data
- Applications with user-generated content
- E-commerce and financial applications
- Applications requiring security compliance
- Public-facing web applications

<a name="less-suitable"></a>
## Less Suitable

- Legacy applications with extensive inline scripts that cannot be refactored
- Applications in early development with rapidly changing content sources
- Internal tools with very controlled user access (though still recommended)
