# Keep the Standard Folder Structure

<a name="introduction"></a>
## Introduction

Laravel has a standard folder structure. The structure can be adjusted as desired, but it is generally not recommended to deviate too much from this.

<a name="why"></a>
## Why

- By not deviating too much from the standard folder structure, your project remains clear and recognizable. This pays off when implementing Laravel upgrades and onboarding and collaborating with other developers.  
- You don't have to reinvent the wheel. The folder structure is a conscious division, so you have to make fewer choices about where to place certain things. This saves time and allows new functionalities to be developed faster.  
- Your project is more compatible with packages. Because everything is where it belongs, you will encounter fewer errors.
